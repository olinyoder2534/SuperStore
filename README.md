Create a model to predict if a person will take part in a promotion
* Classification
  * Logistic Regression (using lasso for feature selection)
    * Best for interpretability, which will be important later
  * Random Forest
  * SVM or other method?
Once the model is created, evaluate important variables
* Clustering
  * K-means
  * DBSCAN
  * Gaussian Mixture Model
  
Evaluate which clusters, in coordinating with the models, are most likely to take part in a promotion
