Create a model to predict if a person will take part in a promotion

* Classification

    * Best for interpretability, which will be important later
  * Random Forest
  * SVM or other method?

* Clustering
  * K-means
  * DBSCAN
  * Gaussian Mixture Model
  
Evaluate which clusters are most likely to take part in a promotion. Create a marketing plan based on the clustering and in coordination with the models.
